## Reporting bugs and/or errors
If you found or encounter any errors/bugs/incorrect data/missing data/crashes, feel free to raise an issue. I'll try to reply them as soon as I can. It would be helpful if you can include a description on what where you doing before the error/crash or a step on how to reproduce the error/crash consistently. This would help me a lot to troubleshoot and fix the app.
